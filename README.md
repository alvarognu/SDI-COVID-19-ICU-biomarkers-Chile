# COVID-19 ICU Mortality Prediction: SDI Biomarker Analysis

This repository contains the dataset and the computational workflow used to develop and validate the **Shape Descriptor Index (SDI)**, a novel statistical methodology for predicting ICU mortality in Chilean COVID-19 patients based on admission biomarkers.

## 📋 Project Overview

The study analyzes a cohort of 98 severe COVID-19 patients admitted to Chilean ICUs during the pandemic peak (January–September 2021). The core innovation is the **Shape Descriptor Index (SDI)**, which identifies prognostic biomarkers by integrating conventional statistical significance with morphological divergence (kurtosis and interquartile range) between the distributions of survivors and non-survivors.

## 📂 Repository Structure & File Descriptions

### 1. `COVID_First_measurements_records.sqlite`

* **Type**: SQLite Database.
  
* **Description**: Contains the raw, anonymized clinical data and laboratory measurements (58 routine analytes) recorded at the time of ICU admission.

* **Usage**: Primary data source for the analysis script.

### 2. `Data_analysis_article_COVID_2026.ipynb`

* **Type**: Jupyter Notebook (Python 3).
  
* **Description**: This is the master analytical pipeline. It reproduces all statistical procedures described in the manuscript. Key steps include:


* Data extraction and consolidation from the SQLite database.


* Distributional analysis (Shapiro–Wilk normality tests).


* Calculation of the SDI for 58 biomarkers.


* Effect size estimation (Cohen's  and Cliff's ).


* Generation of high-resolution visualizations (Violin plots).





### 3. `Suplementary_Table_1.xlsx`

* **Type**: Excel Spreadsheet.
* **Description**: The supplementary dataset generated by the Jupyter notebook. It provides a comprehensive statistical breakdown (mean, median, p-values, SDI scores, and effect sizes) for all 58 biomarkers analyzed across both patient groups.



### 4. `survivors.xlsx` & `non-survivors.xlsx`

* **Type**: Excel Spreadsheets.
 
* **Description**: Pre-processed subsets of the original data, partitioned by clinical outcome (Survivors vs. Non-survivors).


* **Usage**: Facilitates direct inspection of the distributional characteristics used to calculate the SDI.

## 🔬 Key Results

The SDI methodology identified **9 critical biomarkers** that outperformed conventional statistical filters by showing  distributional divergence:


**LDH** (35.7%), **Troponin I** (33.3%), **Creatinine** (33.0%), **** (28.0%), **** (28.0%), **Immature Granulocytes** (26.3%), **AST** (25.9%), **Total CK** (25.9%), and **Platelets** (25.0%).



## 🛠️ Requirements

The analysis requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:

* `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy` (statistical analysis)
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (visualization)
* `sqlite3` (database management)
